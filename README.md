# Scrabble
Project that I did for my Intro_programming course @ FMI, Sofia University.

A simple implementation of a Scrabble game. 

More specifically, it is a program through which letters are generated for the user
and it compiles a word that exists in a given dictionary. Based on this, for a certain number of rounds, 
he collects a score, which is printed after the end of the game. The game also contains several additional functionalities, 
such as changing the number of submitted letters and the number of rounds.

Here is the link where I got the dictionary from: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/README.md
